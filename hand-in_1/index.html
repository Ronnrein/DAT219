        <p>My name is Ronny and i am a 25 year old man from Kristiansand, Norway. I study for my masters in multimediatechnology and will pursue a career in software development.</p>
        <p>On this page i will talk about why i chose the education path i have pursued, as well as talk about some of my interests</p>

            <h2>Multimediatechnology</h2>
            <div class="header-widget" id="header1-widget"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>I have always been interested in technology, and in particular multimediatechnology. Anything technical, from programming to audio engineering and video, have been my hobbies. It was therefore natural for me to choose multimediatechnology as my bachelor, and now masters, degree.</p>

        <h2>Why i have chosen this course</h2>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>While i have experience with both web development and working with .net and C#, i have not used these together extensively before. Therefore, it seems natural for me to get to know this better, especially as it is so commonly used when developing internet platforms.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>What i wish to get out of this course</h2>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>I hope that by the completion of this course will have a better understanding as to how develop web applications on the .net platform, as well as improve my overall web development knowledge.</p>

        <h2>Ideas for my project</h2>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>While i have not settled on a concrete project idea yet, i know i will want to make something that is actually usable, and not just something that fulfills the project criteria. I will also want to include as many new concepts and technologies that i am not familiar with as possible in order to learn about them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Here are a couple of ideas</p>

            <p>One of my other great interests is gaming. I mostly like to play roleplaying, adventure, fantasy and strategy games, and i spend a lot of my free time on it.</p>
            <p>I also like to combine my interest in programming with my love of videogames, and like to mod games, as well as develop small games.</p>
